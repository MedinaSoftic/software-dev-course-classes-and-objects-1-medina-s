# Java Classes and Objects - Methods

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will use java methods to solve a series of problems. You will use provided unit
tests to verify that your solutions are correct.

There are two sets of required exercises in this project: `Calculator` and `StringUtilities`. You will find the 
exercises in the `src/main/java/org/example/` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> You may notice that the build is broken when you open the project and there are errors showing. This is because the 
> methods are not yet implemented and the tests are referencing methods that do not exist. This is expected and you will
> fix this by implementing the methods.
 
> [!TIP]
> We will soon be learning to write our own tests, but for now, you may want to look at the code for the provided tests
> to see how they work and for some clues about how to implement the methods for exercises in this project.

## Calculator Exercises (Required)

You will find the calculator exercises in the `src/main/java/org/example/Calculator.java` file.

This class is empty other than comments explaining the four methods you need to implement. Each method is a calculator
operation.  Follow the instructions in the comments to implement the methods.

Once you have completed the exercises, run the tests in the `src/test/java/org/example/CalculatorTests.java`
file to verify that your solutions are correct.

To run these tests, right-click on the `CalculatorTests` class and select `Run 'CalculatorTests'`.

You will see the results of the tests in the `Run` tab at the bottom of the IDE.

## StringUtilities Exercises (Required)

You will find the string utilities exercises in the `src/main/java/org/example/StringUtilities.java` file.

This class is empty other than comments explaining the methods you need to implement. Each method is a string utility
operation.  Follow the instructions in the comments to implement the methods.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to the Java Basics 1 course for information on common String methods.
